# Polybot Beta Test
> Wow! The Team WP Discord Server almost has a matchmaking bot!

Thank you, friends, for helping me test this little bot I cooked up!

## How to use 🤔
### Instructions
1. Add yourself to a list! Post: `!games sfv 2.5` That adds you to the SFV list for 2.5 hours
1. You can specify a platform! Post `!games tekken 2.5 xbox` You can also specify PC, but the bot will default to PC anyway 😊
1. You can list everyone waiting for all games! Post: `!games`
1. Or just the game you want! `!games sfv`
1. Remove yourself from the list: Post: `!games stop`

Spam as much as you want during this Beta Test, cooldowns exist just in case.
`!g` / `!games` do the same thing. Use whatever you like.
Post or DM the bot with `!games list`  for a list of games the bot accepts.
`!helpme games` gives a deeper how-to.
